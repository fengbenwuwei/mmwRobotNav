# Indoor Environment Data Set

To capture the wireless coverage, we use the powerful ray
tracing package, Wireless InSite by Remcom which has
also been used in several other recent mmWave studies. 
Ray tracing uses a high-frequency approximation to
simulate the electromagnetic paths between any two locations.
As the Gibson dataset contains highly detailed and finegrained
3D models, we need to pre-process them in order
to reduce the computational effort when we use them as ray
tracing environments. Since we consider the navigation and
positioning problems in 2D and most of the buildings in the
data set are multi-story residence buildings, we first select and
extract one floor from each – an example is shown in Fig. 1.

  <em>Fig. 1: Most of 3D models in Gibson data set are the multi-storey
residence, in this example, the left figure shows a three layers house,
and we exact the second floor, as shown on the right, to generate our
test layout.</em>

Next, as shown in Fig. 2, the indoor environment contains
furniture, plants, and irregularly constructed structures. These
objects often have many non-smooth reflecting surfaces, which
significantly increases the amount of computing required for
the ray tracing. To simplify the 3D model, we utilize Habitat-
Sim to capture a floor plan – making the model
essentially 2D. Also, as far as possible, the irregular and
uneven walls, ceilings, and floors of the original 3D model are
transformed into smooth planes. The edges of the simplified
2D floor plan are then vertically extended to create walls. The
resulting 3D map can then be imported to Remcom Wireless
Insite – See Fig. 3.

model. Some assumptions are made to reduce the amount of ray
tracing calculation.</em>
